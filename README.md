# Support Ticket Management System

![Logo](path/to/your/logo.png)

This Laravel-based project is designed to help junior developers practice building a support ticket management system, equipped with multiple user roles and dynamic features. This README provides details on system setup, usage, and additional resources.

## Project Overview

This system facilitates the handling of support tickets with three distinct user roles, each with specialized capabilities:

- **Admins:** Manage all system settings, assign tickets, and view detailed reports.
- **Team Members:** Address assigned tickets, view all tickets, and add internal comments not visible to the ticket creator.
- **Regular Users:** Submit and view their own tickets but cannot edit or delete them.

## Key Features

- **Authentication:** Implemented using Laravel Breeze for streamlined registration and login processes. Users are assigned roles upon registration.
- **Ticket Management:** Users can create tickets with titles, descriptions, and drag-and-drop file attachments. Tickets can be assigned various priorities and statuses and categorized accordingly.
- **Admin Panel:** Features a dashboard with ticket statistics and CRUD operations for managing Labels, Categories, Priorities, and Users.
- **Interactivity:** Ticket pages allow for user comments and display a comprehensive activity log and update history.
- **Notifications:** Automated email notifications alert Team Members about new or updated tickets.

## Visual Design

You are encouraged to use any design template or create a custom design to enhance the user experience and effectively showcase the systemâ€™s functionality.
